# MERN-TODOApp

### TODO-App

- Full Stack Application
- we want to deploy it as one app on heroku in future
- Need to take care of the structure of the application:

Our plan is to have our server inside the main MERN-App folder and client as sub folder inside the MERN-App folder.
We need to send the static files when user is accessing our app because react-build will create a build folder that will contain all of our work as static.

## Functionalities of our app

## FrontEnd

- Registration with email and password and with hashing
- Sign-In
- React-router-dom
- State Management /Context API
- axios / fetch

## Backend

- Basic express server
- Mongoose connection
- Routes
- Controllers
- Models
- Hashing
- Authentication / Token verification
- Authorisation
- Database (MONGODB)
